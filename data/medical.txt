| *Clinging to ancient faith, India tribes seek religion status*                                    | AP News / RNS     | Nov 23, 2022 | Indigenous **Adivasi** tribes in eastern India (Odisha) practice **Sarna Dharma**, a nature-worship faith not officially recognized. Hundreds of tribal worshippers marched to a sacred grove carrying totems, demanding that Sarna Dharma be listed as a separate religion in India’s census. Supporters say official recognition (beyond the “Others” category) is needed to preserve their culture and rights in the face of conversions and assimilation.                                                                                                                                                                                 | **India (Asia)**               | Indigenous (Sarna Dharma)       |

The incident, which caused only minor scorch marks, provoked swift condemnation: Polish leaders and Israel’s ambassador denounced it as **antisemitic hate**. Security footage showed multiple bottles hurled, but no one was injured. The attack came amid a wave of anti-Jewish incidents worldwide since the Israel–Hamas war began, underscoring Jewish community concerns.                                                                                                              | **Poland (Europe)**            | Judaism                         |
| *Indigenous artifacts returned by the Vatican are now at a Canadian museum*                       | AP News (via RNS) | Dec 11, 2025 | The Vatican has handed over 62 Inuit cultural artifacts to Canada’s history museum, to be repatriated to First Nations, Inuit and Métis communities. The  objects – including a hand-carved kayak from the early 20th century – had been in the Vatican’s ethnographic collection.  Inuit and other Indigenous leaders described the transfer as part of the Catholic Church’s reckoning with its colonial past.  Canadian bishops said the items will eventually be returned to the originating communities “as soon as possible”, framing it as an act of reconciliation.                                                                   | **Canada (North America)**     | Indigenous (Inuit), Catholicism |
| *Three dead as protests against Muslim land law turn violent in eastern India*                    | Reuters           | Apr 14, 2025 | In West Bengal (eastern India), **Muslim** communities erupted in protests over a new land management law they said discriminated against them.  Violence flared in Kolkata after clashes in the Murshidabad district: Muslim protesters burned shops, attacked a Hindu family’s home and exchanged gunfire with police. At least three people were killed in the unrest.  The disputed law transfers management of vast tracts of land traditionally overseen by Muslim charities to government-appointed trusts, and critics (as well as India’s prime minister) argue it polarizes Hindus and Muslims.                                     | **India (Asia)**               | Islam, Hinduism                 |

At least 37 people were confirmed dead, including civilians chased into the bush.  Local officials said the raid was likely revenge for villagers killing two militants in self-defense. The attack underscores the deadly impact of the 15-year jihadist insurgency in Nigeria’s northeast, which has displaced millions and targeted both Muslim and Christian communities.                                                                                       | **Nigeria (Africa)**           | Islam                           |
| *Sikh activists in US, Canada face threats a year after Trudeau linked leader’s killing to India* | Reuters           | Aug 13, 2024 | Leaders of the North American **Sikh** community reported a surge of harassment and threats following Canada’s allegation that India’s agents were involved in the June 2023 slaying of Sikh separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar.  Dozens of activists told Reuters they have been doxxed, surveilled, and intimidated online since diplomatic tensions spiked. FBI and Canadian police issued warnings as investigations led to charges against multiple suspects in the Nijjar case.  The episode has increased fears among Sikhs abroad of “transnational repression,” as reports of anonymous threats (some possibly from abroad) have grown. | **US, Canada (North America)** | Sikhism                         |
| *Hindus in Bangladesh try to flee to India amid violence*                                         | Reuters           | Aug 8, 2024  | Following a coup in Dhaka, hundreds of Bangladesh’s minority **Hindus** attempted to cross into India after mobs vandalized their homes, temples and businesses.  The Hindu-Buddhist-Christian Unity Council reported attacks on Hindus in 45 of 64 districts, with a schoolteacher killed and dozens hurt.  Hindus (about 8% of Bangladesh’s population) largely supported the ousted secular Awami League; after its leader’s fall, many feared retribution and instability.  Reports described convoys of Hindu families blocking border crossings into India, as regional leaders scrambled to provide protection.                        | **Bangladesh (Asia)**          | Hinduism                        |
