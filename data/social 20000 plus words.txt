Rumours of a major prisoner release from Belarus had been swirling for a couple of days.

But no one would reveal the names on the list, or the exact number, until everyone was safely out, finally free.

In total,123 political prisoners have been released, including some of the best-known names among Belarusian opposition politicians, human rights activists and journalists.

Maria Kolesnikova, the protest leader with a famous red-lipsticked smile, was on the release list.

A video of her jumping for joy and hugging other former prisoners, overjoyed to be reunited, was soon flying around social media. Then came another, on a bus out of Belarus, where she thanked everyone who'd helped bring this moment about.

"It's a feeling of incredible happiness to see those who are dear to me, to hug them and realise we are all free," Masha, as she's best known, told the camera, her lips already painted red again.

The first sunset of her freedom was a thing of great beauty, she said.

"But I also think of those who are not yet free and I await the moment when we can all embrace, when all are free."

Out too is Viktor Babaryka, a banker who tried to run for president in 2020 but was locked up before the elections even began.

The Nobel Peace prize winner Ales Bialiatski has also been released from a 10-year sentence.

All were imprisoned for their opposition to the authoritarian rule of Alexander Lukashenko, whose security forces crushed the mass protests of 2020 with brutal force. They were the biggest challenge to his rule that he has ever faced.

The prisoners' release now is the result of long and complex negotiations led by the US that culminated in a two-day visit to Minsk this week by Donald Trump's new special envoy, John Coale.

For Lukashenko, that engagement itself is a win: after years as a political pariah in the West he is clearly happy to be back on talking terms with the US.

But he also got US sanctions dropped on a key export for his country, potash, as a further, more tangible reward. EU penalties - and tougher policies - are still in place.

It's not entirely clear what Trump has to gain from this. But Belarus is a close ally of Russia, including in its war on Ukraine, and the move comes as the US has been re-engaging with Moscow too, seeking a peace deal.

The dozens of prisoners Lukashenko agreed to let go were always expected to come here to Vilnius, Lithuania, where a crowd of friends, relatives and fellow activists gathered outside the US embassy in the freezing cold to greet them.

Some came wrapped in the red and white opposition flag of Belarus.

Tatsiana Khomich, Masha Kolesnikova's sister who had campaigned for over five years for her release, couldn't stop smiling. "I've just spoken to Masha," she told me after a video call.

A professional flautist before the disputed 2020 elections, Kolesnikova spent much of her sentence in solitary confinement, denied even letters and phone calls to her family.

"She's fine, she's good. I just want to hug her. I still can't quite believe it," her sister said.

Suddenly, there was a commotion in the crowd: a police car, blue lights flashing, was heading towards the US embassy gates, leading a small convoy of other vehicles.

But there was no way all 123 ex-prisoners were inside. Instead, we learned, just seven foreign nationals had been brought to Lithuania and only Ales Bialiatski of the Belarusians.

'Optimism and activism'
The others, including Kolesnikova, had been taken out of Belarus to Ukraine: from prison, into a war zone.

Staying in their own country is not usually an option on offer.

"Lukashenko's idea, who else?" was how one of opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya's team interpreted the surprise diversion to Ukraine. It seems he'd decided to play one final power game, so the family reunions, so long awaited, would be delayed.

But what of the price paid for that moment? Tikhanovskaya is a friend and political ally of Masha Kolesnikova, but she always calls for maximum pressure on Lukashenko by the West.

So has the US gone too far, I wondered.

"This is a process of negotiation. Of course, it would be good for us if nothing is given to Lukashenko, because all those people are hostages of his regime. They are innocent.

"But this is how negotiation goes," she replied, before noting that sanctions can always be reapplied if necessary.

"President Trump now uses carrots. He also can use sticks."

A few steps away, a man waving a giant flag worried that Lukashenko would just take more prisoners. This is not a sign of sudden humanity, he said.

After a short time inside the US embassy, Ales Bialiatski emerged onto the street to ecstatic cheers from the crowd.

Gaunt, head shaven and still in his padded blue prison jacket, he admitted his head was spinning from all the sensations after four years in jail.

"I was driven across Belarus in a blindfold, from east to west, so I still can't get my head round it. This is so emotional," he shared, describing being woken at 04:00 and told by his prison guard to pack.

When I asked what he wanted now most of all he didn't hesitate: "I want to see my wife!"

She's on her way, I was told.

Bialiatski's own organisation, Viasna, monitors political detentions in Belarus and the activist reminded everyone that many hundreds of people like him - only less well known - have been left behind bars.

"It is very important for everyone to continue to work for those political prisoners who are still in Belarusian prisons, to strive for the complete release of all of them."

Then, lifting the red and white flag from his shoulders, he had a message for Belarusians everywhere.

"Optimism and activism," Ales Bialiatski told them, with a sudden smile. "Never give


A charity that owns a hall and grounds has entered administration following financial difficulties.

Whitwell Hall Country Centre in north Norfolk has used its 40 acres of grounds to provide children with residential, outdoor education experiences since 1938.

John McKean, the centre's manager, said staff had been "badly let down by trustees".

The charity's trustees said the funds raised by bookings were no longer covering essential outgoings such as wages and insurance.

As well as hosting schools, the charity organised community transport for people living in the Reepham, Norfolk, and social activities for older people in the community.

Mr McKean, who remains employed by the charity and stays on site to care for the building, said the arrival of administrators was a "huge shock".

"It's been my life and place of work and home for 29 years," he said.

"I was married here, I've brought up my own two children here.

"It's been my home, Norfolk's become my home."

Three of the charity's four staff had recently been made redundant, he added, and the team's wages had not been paid since August.

He confirmed that no schools that booked to visit Whitwell Hall in 2026 had paid deposits, so would not be financially impacted by its closure.

He added he was aware of the charity being £40,000 in debt.

In a statement, the charity's trustees said they sought professional advice when it became clear the income from groups using the centre was not meeting expenditure.

"There were no funds to renew the insurance for the company and this, potentially, would have put lives at risk," the statement said.

"We are of the opinion that the Covid lockdown, the recent economic climate and the increasing pressures on school staff and the curriculum, have been the major contributory factors in fewer bookings, and bears no reflection on the hard working and committed staff at Whitwell."

Administrators Parker Andrews said the charity was cash-flow insolvent and as a result has ceased trading immediately.

Mr McKean said the hall and its grounds were worth in the region of £2m and that if it was sold the proceeds would be shared by charities with a similar ethos as Whitwell Hall Country Centre.

This was confirmed by the trustees who said they were "deeply saddened" by the site's closure.

Legislation that would establish education centres outside of school premises, which the minister said would better support the needs of all pupils, has progressed despite concerns over safeguards.

The House of Keys passed the second reading of the Education (Amendment) Bill, which aims to update existing 2001 laws.

Education Minister Daphne Caine said the key themes of the legislation were alternative provision of education, better support for looked after children, and changes to admissions and school capacity.

However, some MHKs voiced concerns on the safeguards included in the legislation for alternative provision centres.

Those facilities would see pupils who struggled in a conventional setting referred by their school to the centre to be taught under a personalised plan, while remaining registered with their school.

'Incredibly important'
Lawrie Hooper claimed the bill "not salvageable" and questioned where the funding would come from for the creation of the Alternative Provision Centres.

He also argued as the facilities were not considered schools, existing education legislation which covers protections for teachers, such as the ability to confiscate items, and the requirement for independent inspections would not apply to them.

Part of the Bill would enable a school to turn a pupil away if they were too violent, however, Joney Faragher argued it could turn those children - who she said had likely experienced trauma - away from education altogether.

She also voiced concerns about amendments that would enable headteachers to close a year group from those in the catchment area on capacity grounds, and questioned which schools children would have to go to instead, how they get there and what the impact would be.

However, Chris Thomas said it was an "incredibly important" piece of legislation and it recognised that the island needed to provide for those growing up who were affected by trauma.

Caine argued that alternative provision centres would ensure the wellbeing of all students without compromising their educational needs.

Restricting admissions to schools would not happen unless it was "absolutely necessary", she said.

"This Bill represents a considerable step forward in modernising education legislation, ensuring that our policies are fit for purpose and responsive to the needs of children and young people on the Isle of Man," she added.

The second reading was passed with 18 MHKs in favour and six against.

The British Wildlife Centre in Surrey is celebrating a quarter of a century of being open to the public, at the forefront of conservation.

The centre, in Lingfield, was founded by former dairy farmer David Mills, who was awarded an MBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours in 2016.

At 82, Mr Mills, who is Dame Judi Dench's partner, continues to lead the campaign to get everyone, especially children, to appreciate, respect and protect Britain's native wild species.

He said England had the "most depleted" wildlife in Europe and the centre wanted to show people the "wonderful wildlife we have in this country".

"If they at least get interested in it, they might say 'well that's worth preserving'," he said.

The centre is home to a number of native species, including polecats, mink, stoats, weasels, red squirrels, owls, badgers, otters, foxes, harvest mice, deer and Scottish wildcats.

Mr Mills said the "devastating decline" of Britain's wildlife was partly caused by a lack of spaces for animals to live where they were not in conflict with humans.

He said: "It's so sad, we need to make space for wildlife. Your garden is very important for wildlife and here at the centre we show you what you can do to encourage it."

The centre said one in six species was at risk of extinction due to factors such as habitat loss, climate change and pollution.

It opens on weekdays in term times to facilitate school visits "so [the children] develop a life-long interest in protection and survival".

A new education centre that will be used to train apprentice engineers has been opened at the Great Central Railway in Leicestershire.

The Robinson Centre will be used to teach apprentices at the heritage railway and host engagement programmes with local schools.

The new facility is located at the railway's locomotive repair works at the north end of Loughborough station.

Martin Traynor, chair of Loughborough Town Deal - which backed the project with £280,000 of funding - said the centre would help train the next generation of rail engineers.

As well as the new centre, the project also included the refurbishment of the existing locomotive shed where the restoration and maintenance of historic steam trains takes place.

The total cost of the project is £780,000, Charnwood Borough Council said.

Mr Traynor said: "The education centre is a state-of-the-art building with modern technology to teach the next generation of engineers, while also demonstrating the heritage of the site.

"We are proud to have supported a project which will help continue their work for years to come."

The funding provided by Loughborough Town Deal was part of a £16.9m pot received from the government's Towns Fund.

Malcolm Holmes, general manager at the Great Central Railway, added the organisation was "incredibly grateful" for the investment.

"As a not-for-profit, volunteer-led organisation, this backing is vital," he said.

"It helps us protect the railway for generations to come, preserve traditional engineering skills and inspire the young people who will carry this heritage forward.

"The Robinson Centre will play a key role in ensuring our history remains alive for the future."
Inspectors found a city's sexual health service could have placed people at risk by leaving test swabs uncovered and "open to contamination".

The CQC rated Solutions 4 Health (S4H) Newcastle "inadequate" and placed it in special measures after finding it breached legal regulations.

The private company took over from the NHS in 2023, after Newcastle Hospitals Trust did not make an offer to continue its contract for Newcastle City Council.

The Labour-led authority said it decided to "mutually end the contract" and find a new provider, which would begin a "managed handover" by the end of January 2026.

S4H Newcastle offers services including testing and treatment for sexually-transmitted diseases (STIs), contraception and family planning advice.

The inspection in July was the service's first, the CQC said.

Inspectors found "new swabs and pots for chlamydia and gonorrhoea testing were being stored under the staining sink in open boxes, leaving them open to contamination".

New provider sought
Inspectors concluded the service was in breach of legal regulations in relation to safeguarding, staffing, the safety of premises and equipment and how the service was managed.

Eleven records had no documentation of people's medical history, allergies, lifestyle review or safeguarding assessments.

And the service was experiencing delays in receiving test results, which led to people receiving delayed treatment.

Alice Wiseman, director of public health at Newcastle Council, said: "Unfortunately the outcome of the report comes as no surprise."

The council said it was in contact with the CQC and had commissioned a review even before the inspection "following concerns raised by staff and the public".

It informed S4H in July that it was "seeking mutual termination", but said the private company would still run the service in the interim.

The local authority added that it had seen improvements in the service since the inspection.

Ms Wiseman said: "Procurement of a new provider began last week and we are confident of quickly finding a new supplier.

"We wish to reassure the public that the council, S4H and the new provider (once identified), will endeavour to minimise any disruption to patients and staff as the service and staff transfer over."

The service was previously based at New Croft House in the city centre, before moving to Hadrian House where the inspection took place. It is now based at Ravensworth Terrace.

Jersey's treasury minister has admitted she is concerned about the amount of money the health department is getting in the government's proposed budget.

The government's proposed budget for 2026-2029 is scheduled to be debated in the States Assembly on Monday.

The amount assigned to health is set to be £381m, a nearly £60m increase from 2025 when its budget was £322m.

In September the health minister Deputy Tom Binet defended what he described as a "disproportionate" increase to his budget as he said the service had been consistently underfunded.

Deputy Elaine Millar, the treasury minister, acknowledged the increase to the health budget was "concerning".

She said: "It's concerning, it would be concerning for any department to see that level of growth of spending and that demand in spending."

She explained there were legitimate reasons for the health budget to be increased.

Millar said: "We are not alone, nearly everywhere in the western world is looking to increase health spending.

"So we are seeing an increase in spending that's due to more people living longer and living longer with illnesses that need to be treated.

"Health inflation is bigger than inflation in the rest of the economy."

The corporate services review panel, which reviews the budget, criticised the proposed health spending.

The panel said "despite well-recognised pressures" with the health system the budget "does not set out concrete measures to urgently address them, relying instead on longer term work to develop a sustainable funding model".

Long-awaited plans for a new GP surgery have been delayed again after NHS bosses said it was unaffordable.

Negotiations with the developer, Assura, have collapsed more than a decade after work had been due to start on a new surgery at Great Western Park in Didcot.

The Integrated care board (ICB) for Oxfordshire, working with NHS England and the District Valuer concluded the latest proposals did not offer value for money and said it would be looking for an alternative partner for the project.

Ian Snowdon from South Oxfordshire District Council said he was "angry" with the delay and "embarrassed with how long this has taken".

A mental health charity has launched an advent calendar which shares celebrity messages to encourage people to talk about mental health.

Spark UK, a charity launched in North Devon, has released its fifth and final advent calendar which includes celebrities such as Sir Stephen Fry, Henry Rowley and Alfie Boe.

The non-profit mental health charity was launched in 2020 by teenager Conor Warren with the aim to help young people to talk about mental health and to provide them with accessible resources.

Mr Warren said its advent calendar theme was "a message to my younger self" and it had been "an amazing journey" with the amount of celebrity support it had received.

He said: "This final year feels really special, as we reflect on how far we've come and the legacy the calendar leaves behind.

"Seeing celebrities take to their own platforms to talk about mental health is exactly what we hoped for when we started, sparking conversations everywhere."

Stephen Fry was day one of the advent calendar and said he would tell himself: "Don't be so upset - it's going to be okay."

He said: "There'll be trips along the way, but one thing I really want you to understand is that you're not alone.

"You're not alone in any of the senses in which you think you're not alone, in the wider and perhaps most important sense, everybody feels, as you do.

"Somehow the rest of humanity learned lessons about how to live and how to be and how to love and how to negotiate every day and that you were, I don't know, you were away for that lesson."

Mr Fry said it may feel like everybody else "has a secret" way of dealing with mental health but said it was "all nonsense - everybody feels that".

'Break the stigma'
Spark UK has set up Spark Schools, a digital wellness hub of educators and Spark Youth, a platform offering mental health education and support for people aged 16-25.

The charity aims to launch Sparkie & Friends - a child self-care series through storybooks and an education programme.

Mr Warren said the charity had started to "normalise mental health, especially for young people, because open conversations are what help break the stigma".

"We are immensely proud of what we've achieved so far and are excited by what the future holds for Spark UK in supporting youth mental health."

n November, Israeli flags suddenly appeared beside a highway in the Palestinian West Bank. More than 1,000, placed about 30 yards apart on both sides of the road, stretching for roughly 10 miles. They were planted south of Nablus, close to Palestinian villages regularly targeted by extremist Israeli settlers. I saw the flags on my way to visit those villages, the morning after they were put up. Their message echoed the ubiquitous graffiti painted by settlers across the West Bank: “You have no future in Palestine.”

Compared with the 70,000 Palestinians killed in Gaza and more than 1,000 in the West Bank since October 2023, the flags amount to no more than a minor provocation. But they reflect how dominant Israel has become in the West Bank, land recognised under international law as belonging to the Palestinians. During the second intifada, the Palestinian uprising from 2000 to 2005, Israeli settlers would not have risked planting such flags, for fear of coming under fire from Palestinians. Not now.

I returned to the West Bank last month for the first time in 20 years. In the early 2000s, I had visited regularly as a correspondent for the Guardian, in support of Jerusalem-based colleagues covering the second intifada. The uprising was much more violent than the first, which ran from 1987 to 1993. The enduring image of the first is of Palestinian youths throwing rocks at Israeli soldiers. The second was a full-scale confrontation, with Israel attacking Palestinian cities and towns with artillery, tanks, helicopters and jets while Palestinians fought back with rifles and explosives. Palestinians ambushed soldiers and settlers in the West Bank, making roads a risky venture, especially at night, and terrorised Israel by sending suicide bombers across its border to attack bus stops, cafes, hotels and anywhere else that was crowded. More than 3,000 Palestinians and more than 1,000 Israelis were killed.

I had not planned to write anything about my trip to the West Bank last month. But I changed my mind when I witnessed how much daily life for Palestinians had deteriorated, how dispirited they have become and how much control Israel and its settlers now exercise over the Palestinian population. I had expected conditions for Palestinians would be worse, but not this much worse.

I had been invited to attend a conference at Birzeit University, on the outskirts of Ramallah, organised by Progressive International, a loose coalition of leftwing organisations and individuals worldwide founded in 2020 by, among others, the former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis and the US senator Bernie Sanders. The conference on the decolonisation of Palestine was organised jointly by Progressive International, the Palestinian thinktank Al-Shabaka and the Ibrahim Abu-Lughod Institute of International Studies at Birzeit. The university’s academics and students have had a long history of protest and clashes with Israeli forces, and the campus has been repeatedly raided by Israeli forces over the last two years.

After the conference, a few attenders set off around the West Bank. I was curious as to why there had been no Palestinian uprising in the West Bank comparable to the second intifada, in support of their compatriots in Gaza. Curious, too, about how much support there was for Hamas in the West Bank, and whether anyone believed that an independent Palestinian state was something we might see in the next few decades. Their responses were varied and complex but consistent themes emerged. One was how demoralised they have become. The other was how far away the prospect of a sovereign independent Palestine now seemed.

Ramallah, the political, cultural and economic centre of the West Bank, looked cleaner, less chaotic and in places, more prosperous than the last time I was there, not that different from many European cities, with billboards advertising restaurants, speciality chocolate shops and the opening of new gyms. Young, fashion-conscious Palestinians sat chatting in cafes and bars; according to some of the older generation, they are generally less concerned about politics.

But this air of normality and prosperity is doubly deceptive. First, Ramallah is not typical of the rest of the West Bank. And second, one of the reasons Ramallah appears so different and less chaotic is the absence of so many of the villagers from surrounding areas who used to line the sides of the city’s streets with their piles of fruit and vegetables. Faced with an expanding maze of Israeli checkpoints and gates that make a journey uncertain, many farmers no longer make the trip to Ramallah. The obstacles are a deterrent not only to farmers but to trade and business generally throughout the West Bank.

At the end of the second intifada, there were, according to the UN, 376 checkpoints and barriers in the West Bank. Today there are an estimated 849, many of them erected in the last two years. Checkpoints and barriers are a topic of conversation among Palestinians in much the same way weather is in the UK. While an app that provides information supplied by bus drivers and other road users helps, it is no guarantee, as I found, that roads will be open. The occupation is colour-coded: red metal barriers are closed much of the time, and yellow ones are open more frequently. Yellow Israeli number plates grant access to roads denied to those driving with green Palestinian plates.

Israeli army incursions into the centre of Ramallah have become more common over the past two years. Israeli soldiers arrive in force, make arrests and leave. In a raid in August, they targeted currency exchanges, made five arrests and, according to Palestinians, left more than a dozen injured by live fire, rubber bullets or teargas.

During a major incursion in 2002, Israel took over much of the city. Its tanks and bulldozers battered into the presidential compound, reducing much of it to ruins and besieging Yasser Arafat, then the Palestinian leader. The darkly lit, cramped rooms in which he was confined until close to his death in 2004 have been left intact, forming part of an Arafat mausoleum and museum. The remains of the compound are a symbol of defiance, from a time when Palestinians were united and there was a sense of hope.

One of the biggest differences between the second intifada and the present day is that Arafat tacitly backed the uprising. His secular Fatah group fought alongside the Islamists – Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad – and the leftwing Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. By contrast, Arafat’s successor, Mahmoud Abbas, who was elected president in 2005, has resisted pressure over the past two years to launch a new uprising in the West Bank. Abbas’s decision is unpopular among Palestinians in the West Bank, according to polls and the Palestinians I spoke to.

Among the few I found who supported Abbas’s decision was Maher Canawati, the mayor of Bethlehem, who, like Abbas and Arafat, is a member of Fatah. He said Abbas had faced lots of criticism. “People wanted him to say: ‘Let’s go fight.’” But the president’s caution had been vindicated, Canawati said. “People in the West Bank understood that this was not the time to do what they did in the first and second intifada. We do not want to give them an excuse to attack us. We are helpless. We are not at the same level as the Israelis,” Canawati said. “If we decided to go with an uprising, it would give them the green light to retaliate as they did in Gaza.”

From the mayor’s office, it is possible to see the Church of the Nativity, where steps lead to a grotto celebrated by Christians as the birthplace of Jesus. In 2002, during the second intifada, Israeli forces held the church under siege for 39 days, firing at Palestinian militants holed up inside. Few tourists realise that close to the steps to the grotto, the bodies of the Palestinian dead had been left to rot. Not that there are that many tourists these days. Canawati, a Christian whose family has lived in Bethlehem since the 17th century and owns The Three Arches, one of the biggest suppliers in Palestine of biblical souvenirs, said tourism had dwindled to almost zero in the past two years.

It is not just tourism that is suffering. The economy of the West Bank as a whole is dire. Per capita, income is down 20% and unemployment hovers around 33%. On top of this, while the population is suffering, the Palestinian Authority, nominally responsible for administration of the West Bank and run by Fatah, is synonymous with corruption, embezzlement, dodgy contracts and nepotism. Palestinians I spoke to were incensed by the way jobs were so often awarded not on merit but on family links, contacts, backhanders or political affiliation.

It is not hard to find examples. While wandering around the centre of Tulkarm, in the north of the West Bank, a stall-holder called me over to chat. He said he had been a star student at university, gained a degree in law and proudly showed his membership card of the Palestinian bar association. So why was he working at a fruit and vegetable stall? He said he just did not have contacts inside the PA that would open the way to a legal career.

Canawati acknowledged there was corruption but softened this admission by adding “like other countries”. Given the unpopularity of Abbas, the PA and Fatah, I asked Canawati how Hamas would fare if there was to be an election in the West Bank. Hamas would have “no chance”, he said, though almost everyone else I spoke predicted Hamas would win. In the absence of national legislative elections – there have been none since 2006 – student council elections at Birzeit University are viewed as a barometer of sorts. In the last election in 2023, before 7 October, an Islamist bloc affiliated to Hamas won 25 of the 51 seats while a Fatah-affiliated group took 20 and one affiliated to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine took six.

Raising the 7 October massacre, in which more than 1,200 Israelis and foreigners were killed and about 250 taken hostage, invariably provoked a strong reaction. Why, Palestinians would angrily ask, take 7 October as a starting point? Why not start with repeated Israeli airstrikes on Gaza that left thousands dead between 2005 and 2023? They viewed Hamas as part of the resistance and few that I met were prepared to criticise the attack.

One of the exceptions was Omar Haramy, director of Sabeel, a centre for Palestinian liberation theology based in Jerusalem. In his view, Palestinian civil society’s failure to have a serious discussion about the massacre is a problem. As we spoke, he was standing near the Jaffa Gate entrance to the Old City of Jerusalem, close to Israel’s Kishle police station. Haramy, who said he had been held there and questioned many times, suggested that if Palestinians had put pressure on Hamas early on, maybe they would have released the children, women and elderly people who had been taken hostage. “Is this the values we want as Palestinians? To take babies as hostages? For God’s sake. This is not who we are.” He viewed the various factions and political parties as a burden in the push for liberation. “They are all complicit, with no elections, with no vision. It’s all sad and messed up.”

The most serious change since my last visit to the region is the expansion of Israeli settlements. There are 3.3 million Palestinians living in the West Bank, including 435,000 in East Jerusalem. The number of Israeli settlers has jumped from 400,000 at the time of the second intifada to more than 700,000 now. But those figures do not convey the extent of the encroachment of the settlements, their suffocating impact, occupying more hilltops overlooking cities, towns and villages and even setting up in the middle of them, behind walls and barbed wire, often only yards from Palestinian homes, and protected by Israeli soldiers.

During the second intifada, I interviewed the leader of a small settlement in the centre of Hebron, whose population was overwhelmingly Palestinian. When I asked him what he thought of Palestinians, he replied they were “animals”. When I told him I would quote him, he did not attempt to retract the statement. I have never been able to shake off the memory of that casual contempt. But it seems tame in comparison with what is happening today, as settlers, encouraged by extremists in the Israeli cabinet, harass Palestinians with increasing frequency and viciousness, rampaging through villages with impunity, intimidating Palestinians in an attempt to drive them out.

About 10 miles from Hebron is the hillside village of Umm al-Khair, infamous as the scene of violent confrontations with settlers. Eid Siliman Hathaleen, a Palestinian Bedouin and community activist from the village, said the Bedouins had bought the land in 1952 but settlers and the Israeli army are conducting a sustained campaign against them. Palestinian homes have been demolished while settlers expand their presence. Seven new mobile homes appeared overnight in October in the middle of the village, while an Israeli order had come to demolish a further 14 Palestinian homes.

The village, like the rest of the West Bank, is under constant surveillance from cameras, military vehicles and drones. While we chatted, Israeli soldiers arrived. An hour before, Israeli peace activists who had turned up in a show of solidarity with the villagers were moved after soldiers declared the location a closed military zone, Hathaleen said. The soldiers told us the place we were standing was now too designated a closed military zone.

While Hathaleen and young soldiers argued about the military order, a senior figure in uniform, heavily armed and wearing a black balaclava and dark glasses joined us. Exasperated by the exchanges, he eventually said: “You have four minutes. Go. Goodbye.” Hathaleen, who said the soldiers had come at the request of settlers, filmed the confrontation on his phone, a potentially risky provocation – but one that ended peacefully. Hathaleen said his father, Siliman Hathleen, also a community activist fighting against demolitions, died after being hit by an Israeli police truck in 2022. His cousin, Awdah Hathaleen, a consultant on the Oscar-winning documentary No Other Land, was shot dead in the village by a settler in July.

In Palestinian villages south of Nablus, representatives of agricultural cooperatives and women’s organisations told us of attacks from settlers descending from the hilltops to beat them up, destroy property and spread a poisonous white powder that killed crops. In one village, farmers, coming up with ingenious ways to counter this, had started growing vegetables in barrels filled with uncontaminated soil.

Is it possible that anger with Israeli military incursions and settler attacks – not to mention the destruction of Gaza – will provoke large-scale retaliation, a third intifada, in the West Bank? The Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research, in a poll in October, found 49% of Palestinians in the West Bank – and 30% in Gaza – still favoured armed struggle as the most effective way to achieve a Palestinian state.

Abdaljawad Omar, assistant professor of philosophy at Birzeit, who goes under the pen name Abboud Hamayel, is sceptical about the possibility. He has written a forthcoming book about the Palestinian resistance. He does not advocate a return to violence but regretted the prevailing fatigue and paralysis, what he calls “emotional hollowing”. He said: “Anger has mutated into impotent resentment. Today stones are seldom thrown in the West Bank. This is something new … Resistance is slowly becoming a memory.”

The hotbed of resistance in the second intifada was the refugee camps, many of which date back to 1948, when roughly 750,000 Palestinians were expelled or fled from their homes in what became the state of Israel. At the entrance to the Aida refugee camp in Bethlehem there is an arch above which rests a huge key, symbolising the hope that one day its inhabitants might go back to Israel to reclaim their former homes. Around the walls of the camp are murals that range from a commemoration of Palestinian heroes, such as stone-throwing youths and guerilla fighter Leila Khaled, to an unflattering painting of US president Donald Trump. Rushing to prayers at midday one Friday, residents had little time to talk but were dismissive of the ceasefire in Gaza – “What ceasefire?” – and ridiculed Trump’s plan for a Gaza Riviera.

The one-tonne metal key fixed above the arch and the murals celebrating resistance feel like symbols from a bygone age, an era that is slipping away, not least because the dream of the refugees of a return to their original homes in Israel is almost certainly never going to be fulfilled. I interviewed a father in another of the camps in Bethlehem during the second intifada who was adamant he, like the other residents, would not leave the camp other than to return to his original home. Does that diehard stubbornness still exist? A former resident of the camps expressed surprise on hearing that families who had been among the most intractable were considering for the first time leaving, ground down, in part, by unemployment, poverty and debt.

The Israeli military is not waiting for them to leave. Earlier this year the IDF demolished large parts of the three of the camps that have been on the frontline of resistance, during the second intifada and since 2023, all three in the north of the West Bank. Israel described the three as “hubs of terror”: Tulkarm, Nur Shams and Jenin. Palestinians said the Israeli military, through flyers and loudspeakers, warned the residents of Aida and other camps they, too, will be destroyed unless they behave.

When the Israelis mounted an incursion into the Jenin refugee camp in 2002, they met fierce resistance. I interviewed an Israeli sergeant at the time, Israel Kaspi, a combat veteran who had seen service in the Yom Kippur war in 1973 and in Lebanon in 1982, who said the fighting in Jenin had been the most intense he had ever been involved in. The Palestinians had turned the refugee camp into a fortress, he said. Israel lost 23 soldiers as they fought from street to street, house to house, and room to room, amid booby-traps, explosives hidden in alleyways and in rubbish bins, dynamite sealed inside walls, and Palestinians firing from well-prepared positions.

Earlier this year, when they attacked the camps in Jenin, Tulkarm and Nur Shams, the Israelis lost three soldiers but managed to empty the camps of a combined total of 30,000 residents, shattering close-knit communities and dispersing them to temporary accommodation elsewhere in the West Bank. An estimated 850 homes and other buildings were destroyed across the three camps.

On a visit to the camps at Tulkarm and Nur Shams last month, I could see tracks of tanks or bulldozers in the muddy road but nothing inside, partly because it was dark but also because venturing further is dangerous. The Israeli military had warned that anyone trying to enter the camps would be shot. This was not an empty threat: three days later a cameraman, Fady Yasmeen, was shot during a protest near the entrance.

I travelled to Tulkarm with Aseel Tork, who works for a not-for-profit organisation that runs community projects in rural areas, in particular for women and the young, the Bisan Centre for Research and Development. It was designated as a terrorist organisation by Israel in 2021, a move condemned by, among others, the United Nations office of the high commissioner of human rights. Tork told me that she believed a third intifada is impossible now. “When the first and second intifadas happened, the Palestinian community as a whole was looking out for one another. There were fewer divisions among us: ideologically, politically, geographically. Right now, we cannot – and have not – stood up for the people in Gaza the way we should have. If an intifada was going to happen, it would have happened after 7 and 8 October.”

At an event in Ramallah in November, titled Poetry after Gaza, a Kafka quote came up in conversation between a European and a Palestinian. I was to hear it again twice during the week from Palestinians in other settings. “Plenty of hope – for God, an infinite amount of hope – only not for us.”

Where do Palestinians look for hope? Few answers are forthcoming. An overhaul of the Palestinian Authority? Elections are long overdue – but problematic from an international standpoint, given the level of professed support for Hamas. Is a two-state solution, an independent Palestine and Israel side by side, even viable, given how much land settlers now occupy in the West Bank? A one-state solution, with Israel as an enlarged apartheid state, in which Palestinians could fight for equal rights, backed by the international community, as in South Africa? One weary Palestinian writer, after declaring the two-state solution dead, said he would settle for a one-state solution if it just meant he would finally be able to move about freely.

A global campaign began last month for the release of Marwan Barghouti, widely regarded as the figure likeliest to unify the Palestinians. Barghouti, accused by Israel of being the leader of Fatah militants in the West Bank during the second intifada, has been in an Israeli jail since 2002, convicted on five counts of murder, which he denies. The longstanding Palestinian hope is that he could emerge from there as a Palestinian Nelson Mandela. Although he is Fatah, he is popular among supporters of Hamas and the other factions. I interviewed Barghouti in Ramallah the year before he was captured and wrote then that I thought he could a future leader. He was impressive but did not have the warmth of Mandela and to me he seemed, maybe unfairly, to be more of a street fighter than a political visionary. But perhaps he has changed while in prison, as Mandela did. Barghouti has been held in solitary confinement since the 7 October attack and been beaten by prison guards four times, the last, in September this year, leaving him unconscious, according to his son Arab.

Barghouti was on a list of prisoners Hamas submitted to Israel to be freed as part of the October ceasefire deal. Although Israel released others convicted of murder, it refused to release Barghouti. Its decision may reflect Israel’s preference for a weak, malleable Palestinian leader, Abbas, to a potentially more forceful figure.

Basem Ezbidi, a leading political scientist and member of the Al-Shabaka thinktank, who was at university with Barghouti, cautioned against expecting a political saviour. “In times of despair, people tend to create myths in which a superhero comes to the rescue,” he said. “People see Marwan Barghouti in that way. But he is not a man who makes miracles. He may be cleaner than others but it is not enough to be clean: you have to have the political skills and the right vision.”

With a shortage of options from within, many Palestinians see the international community as their best hope, believing a turning point has been reached because of worldwide outrage over the destruction of Gaza. At the Birzeit conference, Saleh Hijazi, a policy coordinator for the Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) National Committee, said more pressure had to be put on Israel by ending military ties, enforcing arrest warrants against Israelis accused of war crimes, divestment from complicit companies and expelling Israel from international bodies such as the UN, Fifa and the Olympics. Action is already being taken at state level, as in Malaysia, which closed down ports to Israeli ships, and even in Europe, he said. “We can now begin to see our South Africa moment arrive. But more escalation of BDS is needed.”

Such campaigns might work in the long run, as they did in South Africa. But in the short or medium term they will not change the lives of Palestinians in the West Bank, caught between a Palestinian Authority that cannot protect them and Israel, with its military clampdown and its out-of-control settlers. While the body count in the West Bank was higher during the second intifada, life was absolutely worse now in every other way, said Budour Hassan, a legal researcher at Amnesty International. Hassan, who is from Nazareth, said: “Even back then there was hope, maybe. Now the people seem completely desperate. They feel completely abandoned.”

For the past two years, Manger Square in Bethlehem has been deliberately left in darkness and silence at Christmas time in a show of solidarity with Gaza. On 6 December, the Bethlehem mayor relit the Christmas tree in front of thousands of Palestinians – Muslims as well as Christians – and a scattering of visitors from around the world. Canawati hoped the resumption of festivities will revive tourism. He viewed the relighting of the tree as a symbol of hope and resilience.

“Those who lost hope, they have left,” Canawati told me. (Since 2023, an estimated 4,000 Palestinians have left Bethlehem for abroad.) “I will never leave, regardless of what is going to happen. I know there are many like me,” Canawati said. Describing himself as an optimist, he hoped the reaction to Gaza will push world leaders into supporting the Palestinian cause, and that negotiations initiated by Trump will lead to a peace deal and a sovereign Palestinian state.

But he tempered this with dismay over extremists in the Israeli cabinet and among the settlers. Echoing the despair I found around the West Bank, the mayor said: “The extremists do not want a two-state solution or a one-state solution. The extremists do not want to give us our state or be part of their state. They want the land without the people. They just want us gone.”

was lying on my back in an east London hospital, sometime in August 2023. I don’t know what day it was, exactly; by that point I’d mostly given up caring. My phone rang. I managed to answer, even though I had largely lost the use of my hands. (Luckily, a member of staff had left it lying on my chest.) Also, I wasn’t feeling great. In the early stages of coming to terms with the fact I was paralysed, I had just been informed that the doctors wanted to drill a hole directly into my guts, inserting a plastic tube to drain away my urine, effectively making my penis redundant. It was proving quite a lot to take in.

Nonetheless, I answered.

The person on the other end said they were calling from my local wheelchair service. I sort of registered this was important. By this point, I’d started to get my head around the fact I was never going to walk again. Wheelchairs were going to be a big part of my life. But given I wasn’t going to be discharged from hospital for at least six months, I figured the local wheelchair service could wait until I was a bit more up for the conversation. I apologised, probably somewhat incoherently, and said I wasn’t able to talk right then. I assumed they would understand it wasn’t a good time, and call back later.

I assumed wrong.

A month or so went by. My mum was down from Merseyside, staying in my old flat in north-east London while I remained in hospital. (I never saw that flat again. The stairs made it just another inaccessible location for me, my former home part of a cut-off world.) She checked the post and found a letter from AJM Healthcare’s Waltham Forest wheelchair service, a regional subsidiary of AJ Mobility Ltd – described in its annual report as “leading integrated wheelchair service provider for the NHS, delivering services to a population base of over 8.1 million people”. The letter stated that because AJM had been “unsuccessful in our attempts to contact you … your referral has now been closed”. In other words, because I had failed to engage on the phone the one time that it called me, I had been removed from the waiting list for a wheelchair.

Just to spell that out: I was in hospital, paralysed. I could not leave hospital until I had a wheelchair. The local wheelchair service notified me that I wouldn’t be getting a wheelchair, after speaking to me on the phone for less than 30 seconds. It did so by writing to my home address. Which I could not reach, because I was in a hospital. Without a wheelchair.

So began my involvement with England’s wheelchair services, the patchwork of private companies contracted by the NHS to provide disability equipment to some of the people who need it most. It would prove to be quite a ride.

The rock climbing accident that left me paralysed from the collarbones down happened in June 2023. It took a lot away from me. Continence (both kinds), sexual function, the ability to wash, dress and feed myself and basically anything that requires the proper use of hands (I’m writing this using voice dictation). And yes, most obviously, it also took away my ability to walk.

But it also gave me some new things. Like a sudden introduction to being dependent on bureaucratic entities, to whom you are just another annoying statistic, clogging up the phone lines.

Before the accident, I was a very fit and healthy 36-year-old man, in gainful employment as a university lecturer. I owned my own home, drove my own car and was happily cruising along in a world that made life easy for me.

I did not yet know what it meant to be driven mad by the Department for Work and Pensions’ hold music for an hour, before the government computer hangs up because the phone lines are too busy. (I was calling in response to a threatening letter that said if I didn’t talk to them, I could expect my application for disability benefit, the personal independence payment, to be dismissed.) I did not yet know what it meant to try to organise wheelchair ambulances through G4S (yes, the security firm – don’t ask, because I don’t know). I did not yet know that local wheelchair services are a lottery, in which some of the most vulnerable people in society roll the dice. A lottery in which the taxpayer acts as permanent lender of last resort – while private companies profit.

‘The thing with wheelchair services is that they massively vary in England – it depends on your postcode,” Sarah told me. She is a physiotherapist who has been working with people with spinal cord injury for more than 20 years. “Some are good, but some are just awful.”

Many of her clients are discharged from hospital in heavy manual wheelchairs that an able-bodied person would struggle to push. Frequently, they are the wrong type or size, and are at the very least uncomfortable. “Often,” she said, “people who have impaired function in their upper limbs cannot push these wheelchairs themselves, and become effectively housebound, in some cases confined to their bed. Sometimes, they develop complications from poorly prescribed wheelchairs, and it lands them back in hospital.”

On average, she adds, people have to wait at least 10 months between being discharged and being assessed, let alone getting the wheelchair that is right for them. Often this is because local wheelchair services will refuse to assess a patient until they have left hospital and are back at home. Specifics vary depending on which company has the contract for a given area, but this can either involve a home visit at the convenience of wheelchair services, or a patient having to travel to the local depot to be measured and assessed. This often takes months after hospital discharge, with the result that people who, more than anything, just want to get on with their lives, are stranded in limbo.

Ben, 37, was, like me, injured in a sports accident in the summer of 2023. Like most quadriplegics, he left rehab in a heavy manual wheelchair he could not push outdoors by himself. One afternoon, he asked his live-in care worker to push him down the street so that he could at least go outside. At 65kg he isn’t especially heavy, but the care worker hurt her wrist trying to get him up a slope. She complained to the agency that employs her, and the agency forbade any of Ben’s care workers from pushing him in the manual chair.

“From that point on I was basically under house arrest,” Ben tells me. “It was 10 months before I got my power chair from wheelchair services – even though it was clear long before I was discharged from hospital that I was going to need one.”

And even that wasn’t straightforward. “The crazy thing is, a wheelchair service’s mandate is only to make sure you can mobilise indoors, in your home. On a flat smooth surface, I can do that in a manual wheelchair. But outside, on rough and angled surfaces, I lack the hand and upper body strength.”

As a result, he faced being issued with a wheelchair that would have kept him housebound. “My aim was to go back to work, rebuild my life,” he says. “But to do that, I had to lie to wheelchair services and make out I was more disabled than I am, so that I could get a power chair and access the outdoors.” It was either lie, or give up on having any kind of a life.

“Am I not disabled enough? Surely I should not have to pretend to be even more disabled, just to get something as basic as a wheelchair I can go outside in.”

Like Ben, I waited about 10 months for my prescription wheelchair to be ready. Collecting it meant visiting an industrial estate in Leytonstone, about a 20-minute bus ride away. It was then a 15-minute schlep to the AJM offices. My live-in carer accompanied me, as is now required for me to go pretty much anywhere.

When we got there, I met the clinical lead. He was relatively new to the job, but we managed. Moving into the side room where the new wheelchair would be set up, he asked me to get out of the one I was in, and position myself on the nearby plinth. I explained I couldn’t do that, because I’m a quadriplegic, and require hoisting in situations like this. He looked somewhat concerned. Hoisting?

I gestured with my useless hand at the nearby wall, where an array of hoist slings were hanging. And then at the ceiling, which had a mechanical track hoist attached to it. Using a special mechanical contraption. Hoisting.

He excused himself and got a colleague, who then directed the clinical lead through the hoisting process. It struck me as quite odd that the clinical lead at a wheelchair service didn’t seem to be familiar with hoisting. But I opted to say nothing.

It took a while for my new chair to be set up, but when I was in it the lead asked: “Do you feel comfortable?” Now, this is a tricky question. You see, I don’t feel anything below my collarbones. It is just a dead zone. Although I can roughly work out when my hips aren’t straight, or my bum is too far forwards, this is a deductive process that I was taught to do in spinal rehab. Strictly speaking, I rely on a trained professional to look at me and determine whether my posture is correct, or whether things need adjusting. And this really matters. Postural mispositioning, if uncorrected, leads to pressure ulcers, scoliosis (twisting of the spine) and a host of musculoskeletal deformities.

Still, these guys were the professionals, right? The new chair certainly felt weird. But new wheelchairs normally do. I figured I’d just have to get used to it. After all, if things weren’t set up correctly, how was I to know? Surely, they would tell me.

Once the chair was apparently set up to the clinical lead’s satisfaction, it was time to head home. Unfortunately, the heavens had opened and I didn’t fancy the 15-minute slog back to the bus stop in the tipping rain. Annoyingly, no taxis were accepting my booking on the various apps I was trying. I asked the desk staff if they could call me a wheelchair-accessible taxi. They said they didn’t have any numbers. I tried the apps a little longer. In the end, I just got wet.

Sitting on the bus home, it increasingly felt like something was wrong with the chair. My legs were jutting out at a weird angle, bashing into things when I moved. Breathing felt much harder than it normally did, my diaphragm struggling even more than usual to make up for my emaciated intercostal muscles. Still, I told myself, I’d just have to keep trying. I used to be an athlete; I used to know how to train. Different context, same principle. You have to tolerate the suffering until it becomes easy.

A few days later, my private physiotherapist came round to do my weekly rehab session. She took one look and ordered me out of the chair – with strict instructions not to sit in it again until an engineer had been out to make it safe. At present, she said, I was running the risk of getting pressure sores and muscle damage. She hoisted me on to my bed, and spent most of our session writing down the measurements required to adjust the wheelchair to fit my body.

If I hadn’t had her, who knows how long I would have spent in a chair that could have landed me back in hospital? It was becoming apparent that – just like everywhere else – in the world of wheelchairs, having a bit of money makes life a hell of a lot easier.

In many ways, I am lucky. I was able to keep my job teaching at a university, including a generous year of paid sick leave after the accident. I also had climbing insurance, which meant I got a lump sum payment through the British Mountaineering Council. This wasn’t megabucks, but it helped pay for things such as home adaptations to make my new flat accessible. Also, friends and family clubbed together to raise extra money through GoFundMe, enabling me to buy a high-spec private wheelchair that the NHS would never have agreed to pay for.

I still need the NHS one provided by AJM. Kind of like shoes, one needs different wheelchairs for different purposes – especially when they break down (which they do). But because I was lucky to have a bit of money behind me, I was able to get by without using the AJM chair until it was properly set up. Without it, and without my private physio, I might not have had the issues fixed before finding myself back in hospital. Obviously, that wouldn’t have been great for me. But also, not great for taxpayers, given that the going rate for a hospital bed is now about £900 per day.

Meanwhile, AJM recently reported that its turnover in the financial year to April 2024 increased significantly, to £36.2m (up 29% from 2023). Profit, after tax, was £5.8m.

In last year’s strategic report, AJM listed “reliance on NHS contracts” as a risk to its financial sustainability. I struggle hard to take such a statement at face value. Because how much of a risk is it, really? As the political commentator Sam Freedman has pointed out in his book Failed State, a great deal of public service provision in the UK is going wrong because it has been farmed out under the mantra of privatisation, even in cases where privatisation makes no economic sense. Wheelchair services very much fall under this rubric.

To see why, consider where privatisation does make sense. Take, for example, contracting a private company to do the cleaning at NHS hospitals. It is straightforwardly the case that a private company can do this more efficiently, and therefore more cheaply, than keeping the operation in-house as part of the sprawling NHS behemoth. But more than that, if a contracted company starts failing to do the cleaning properly, it is easy for the NHS to get an alternative company in, virtually the next day, to do exactly the same job. Competition, here, works. Rival firms have to offer generally competitive prices and services to the NHS, because if they don’t, the NHS can easily go elsewhere. Here is a case where privatisation is good for the taxpayer, and in turn, good for the NHS.

Compare this with wheelchair services. Suppose NHS managers somehow became aware of, and dissatisfied with, the performance of AJM in Waltham Forest. It is not like they can just suddenly bring in an alternative wheelchair provider. This is not simply because the NHS is locked into a contract with AJM that would probably prove very costly, even just in legal fees, to get out of. It is also because of the immense difficulty of replacing one wheelchair provider with another.

Just think of the immense disruption involved in handing over the confidential details of thousands of disabled people to a different company, while also overseeing a complete change in stock provisions of expensive and complex medical equipment, much of which is now scattered around the local community. AJM may describe reliance on NHS contracts as a “risk”, but to an outside observer it looks more like the safest bet imaginable. Hence, indeed, why a company that employed under 350 people could post nearly £6m in profit last year.

The result is a strange situation. Insofar as there really is privatisation, it consists of people like me, with enough money in the bank, bypassing local wheelchair services to ensure they get the medical equipment they need. After all, if I want to go through the NHS, I must use AJM, simply because of where I live. AJM have the contract for Waltham Forest wheelchair service provision, so if like me you’re registered with a GP in this borough, they are the only option (unless you want to pay entirely out of your own pocket, which of course most people can’t afford). Patients find themselves at the mercy of whichever business their local council has employed.

The result is an inevitable doom loop. Because when private companies effectively enjoy state-backed local monopolies, and when they are subject to no meaningful competition, they lack any incentives to improve the services they offer, or to provide value for money.

This is a situation that no straight-thinking person should be OK with. Well, unless you’re LivingBridge, the private equity firm that owns AJM, I suppose. Last year, it posted £13.4m in operating profit. (“As a national provider, AJM offers excellent value to our NHS partners through our significant procurement economies of scale,” a spokesperson for AJM told the Guardian. “Our NHS contracts are all fixed budget, with clear and measurable KPIs focused on achieving positive outcomes for patients. AJM contracts are all awarded as a result of competitive tendering, following an NHS procurement process which determines both quality and value for money. Our performance is consistently above the national average.”)

Afew weeks after AJM finally sent out an engineer to resize my chair, I got a call from the clinical lead. He said that he needed a barcode number from the chair I’d gone home with, which he’d forgotten to note down. Could I please get out of the chair, crouch down on the floor and read out the number off the bottom?

I wish I could say I kept my cool. But I was never very good at that, even before my accident. Instead, I raised my voice. I used words I shouldn’t have. Do I regret it? Not really. Because by that point, I knew I wasn’t an outlier.

Take a look at the publicly viewable Google reviews page for AJM Waltham Forest. One comment describes an elderly woman being made to wait more than 19 weeks for a wheelchair. Another is written by a frustrated father whose daughter’s wheelchair is so unsafe that her day centre refuses to take her out in it. The most recent begins: “AVOID AVOID AVOID!!!”

It is presumably for reasons like these that the parliamentary ombudsman wrote to AJM in May 2024, raising concerns after a rise in complaints reported by wheelchair users. In October 2025, the government was forced to acknowledge these complaints – though, rather uselessly, it then advised those with concerns to contact “the relevant integrated care boards”.

What amuses me about the Google reviews is not their content, but the fact that under most of them someone from AJM has offered a reply. It’s the usual mealy mouthed corporate stuff: “Thank you for taking the time to leave a review”; “We are sorry about your experience”; “We always want to find ways to improve our service”.

The reason it amuses me is because after the clinical lead called me up and asked me to get out of my wheelchair, I sent a formal written complaint to AJM Waltham Forest. I never received any reply – not even an acknowledgment of receipt.

I later escalated this to the AJM head office, and got the predictable polite fobbing off. (“You have our assurance that [we] have undertaken an internal investigation and managed the matter through the appropriate AJM Healthcare conduct policy and procedure. In accordance with those, staff disciplinary outcomes remain confidential.”) Still, at least they bothered to reply.

AJM also sent a short statement in response to the claims in this article. It began: “While we cannot comment on individual cases, we are actively supporting those affected to prevent any further delays or miscommunication.” It continued: “We are proud to exceed NHS averages, with 97.4% of 12,830 Friends and Family Test responses rating our service as good or very good. We also recognise the crucial role wheelchair services play in people’s independence, which is why every case matters and we remain focused on continually improving our performance and communication.”

As you’ve probably guessed, by this point I try to have as little to do with AJM as possible. I mostly use the privately bought wheelchair that my friends helped me afford, and rely on the excellent small business Beyond Mobility for help with engineering and maintenance. Still, there’s one thing that continues to bug me.

As a quadriplegic, I am at constant risk of developing pressure ulcers. This is more than just an inconvenience. When pressure ulcers go bad, at best they leave a person bedridden for weeks. If the skin breaks down, a sufferer can end up back in hospital needing surgery, followed by months of inpatient recovery. In the worst cases, the surgery doesn’t work and infection from the ulcer penetrates underlying bones, eventually killing the patient. This is what ultimately saw off the actor Christopher Reeve.

To try to prevent this, the NHS has prescribed me a special pressure-relieving wheelchair cushion. Due to being utterly paranoid about developing pressure ulcers, I long ago bought one for myself. (A cool £650, since you asked. Yes, for a cushion.) Still, it would be very handy to have a spare. Not least because I sometimes shit myself (the delights of spinal cord injury), and I can’t use the privately bought one when the cover is in the wash.

When AJM finally came through with my NHS wheelchair, the cushion I was sent wasn’t right. I asked if the correct make and model could be provided. OK, I was told. That was in October 2024.

I called up every so often, to check on its status, and kept being told it was “on order”. Until May this year, when the chap on the phone denied any knowledge, or record, of me ever having ordered any such cushion. After a few days of tense calls, I was once again assured that the right cushion was “on order”.

It is now December 2025. I called up again the other day. The pressure-relieving cushion, the one to make sure that I don’t end up back in hospital, costing the NHS yet more money, or potentially even dead?


very autumn in the mid-00s, when I lived in China, my friend Scarlett Li would invite me to Shanghai to eat hairy crab. Named for the spiky fur on their legs and claws, the crabs are said to have the best flavour during the ninth month of the lunar calendar. They’re steamed and served whole, with a dip of rice vinegar spiked with ginger. The most prized specimens come from Yangcheng Lake near Suzhou, which is not far from Scarlett’s home town of Wuxi. She had moved to Hong Kong as a child, attended high school and college in Australia, and returned to China to pursue a career as an entrepreneur. Despite her years abroad, she remained Chinese through and through – and eating hairy crab with her, I became Chinese, too.

Beginning in the Tang dynasty in the seventh century, crabs were harvested from the lakes and estuaries of the Yangtze delta and sent as tribute to the imperial court. Twelfth-century Hangzhou had specialised crab markets and dedicated crab restaurants. “I have lusted after crabs all my life,” wrote the 17th-century playwright Li Yu. “From the first day of the crab season until the last day they are sold, I … do not let a single evening pass without eating them …. Dear crab, dear crab, you and I, are we to be lifelong companions?”

In Invitation to a Banquet: The Story of Chinese Food, Fuchsia Dunlop traces the history of this remarkable cuisine through 30 dishes, from slow-braised pork belly to steamed rice. (There are 10 mentions of hairy crab – not to be confused with crab that’s roasted, baked, shredded, stuffed into soup dumplings or steamed buns, or marinated in liquor and served raw in a dish called drunken crab, which gets its own chapter.) Dunlop, who is British, explores the staggering ingenuity and range of a cuisine that she feels has not won the respect it deserves in the world of fine dining: “Only the Chinese have placed [cooking] at the very core of their identity. For the ancient Chinese, the transformation of raw ingredients through cooking marked the boundary not only between humans and their savage ancestors, but between the people of the civilised world (that is, China and its antecedent states) and the barbarians who lived around its edges.”

The result is a gastronomy that is unparalleled for its diversity, sophistication, subtlety and “sheer deliciousness”. Many supposedly modern ideas about eating, Dunlop points out, have been accepted in China for centuries. Consuming the freshest meat, fish and produce, local and in season, has been important since the earliest dynasties. “Certainly to have a fresh fish and to cause it to become unfresh is a terrible act,” wrote Yuan Mei, an 18th-century gourmet and poet. Educated gentlemen through the ages have searched obsessively for the freshest bamboo shoots, the finest vinegar, or the perfect bowl of congee. (It tastes best, according to one connoisseur, when made with rainwater in early spring.) Ingredients should be cooked in small quantities using refined methods that reveal their benwei, or “root flavours”.

The passage of seasons was marked by the fruits and vegetables available in the markets, starting with apricots and cherries in early summer, followed by peaches and melons, then chestnuts, grapes and oranges at the mid-autumn festival and goose pears and quinces at the onset of winter. Everyone knew that the best handmade tofu came from Xiba in Sichuan, just as Nanjing was the place for salted duck, Pixian for chilli bean paste, and the hills around Hangzhou for the most delicate leaves of dragon well green tea. “Concern for the provenance and terroir of ingredients, so important to modern western gourmets, was not the invention of the French or Californians, but has been a preoccupation in China for more than 2,000 years,” Dunlop writes. The Chinese also pioneered imitation meat, free-range chickens, molecular gastronomy, sushi, tofu, soy sauce, ramen and restaurants, which were fashionable gathering places in 12th-century Kaifeng, six centuries before they first appeared in Paris.

Pleasure in eating has always been paired with the need for restraint, and classical texts warned against overindulgence. “Even if there is plenty of meat, [a gentleman] should not eat more meat than rice,” counselled Confucius in the Analects. The ideal has always been to achieve moderation and balance – yin and yang, heating and cooling ingredients, main dishes and rice – in order to nourish the body while living in harmony with nature.

For most of recorded history, ordinary Chinese ate whole grains, legumes and vegetables, used small quantities of meat and fish for flavour, and threw almost nothing away. In rice they found a staple grain that supplies more calories per hectare than any other cereal crop, while myriad preparations of what Dunlop calls the “miraculous” soya bean deliver as much protein as dairy and meat but more economically. This nutritional efficiency allowed China to support a large population on limited arable land, with food that is healthy, satisfying and environmentally sustainable.

Reading Invitation to a Banquet made me think differently about my long-ago crabfests. The Chinese eat freshwater crabs only at the peak of their season, and primarily in the Yangtze delta area near Shanghai. They are cooked and served simply, which allows their benwei to shine. Restraint is built into the experience, yet the freshness, the flavours and the ritual make for meals so satisfying that I can recall them now, detail by detail, 20 years later.

The seductive flavours of China’s local specialities have defined Dunlop’s career. Educated at the University of Cambridge, she first went to live in China in 1994, on a one-year scholarship at Sichuan University in Chengdu to study the government’s policy toward ethnic minorities. She was fortunate to have been sent to a place with one of China’s most distinctive cuisines and found herself taking notes on the food. She quit her studies and enrolled at the Sichuan Higher Institute of Cuisine as one of its first foreign students. Over the past three decades she has built a career explaining Chinese cooking to western readers, initially focusing on Sichuan and then expanding to other regions.

More surprisingly, Dunlop has gained a large following by explaining Chinese food to the Chinese. Her memoir Shark’s Fin and Sichuan Pepper sold about 200,000 copies when it came out in China in 2018. Invitation to a Banquet has sold 50,000 copies since its publication there last year, and two of her cookbooks have also done well. Among Chinese food lovers and chefs, Dunlop is praised for her deep understanding of the country’s culinary history. She’s known, like a celebrity, by her first name: “Fu Xia” in Chinese.

How exactly did a waiguoren – a Cambridge-educated white woman who grew up 5,000 miles away – become accepted as an authority on matters so important to the Chinese? Amid China’s rapid transition to a modern industrialised nation, traditional ways of eating and living are disappearing. It has fallen to Dunlop, an outsider, to study the history, to sift through the tradition, and to taste the dishes as if for the first time. Along the way, she has become the voice of a more authentic past. “It kind of shames us, because it’s our own culture,” He Yujia, her Chinese translator, told me. “She helps us rediscover what we’ve neglected for too long.”

Almost 4,000 years ago, Chinese cooking had already developed certain distinctive traits. One was the divide between grain (fan) and vegetable or meat dishes (cai). A meal must include both, and ritual bronze vessels dating to the Shang dynasty, which began around 1760BC, differ depending on whether they were for serving grain or meat. The cutting of ingredients into small pieces, the mixing of meat and vegetables, and the use of diverse seasonings to create highly varied dishes were all in place by the Zhou dynasty, which dates to around 1046BC. (As the 20th-century writer and philosopher Lin Yutang wrote: “The whole culinary art of China depends on the art of mixture.”) From its earliest days, cooking was seen as a subtle and complex undertaking. “Governing a country,” said Laozi, the founder of Taoism, “is like cooking small fish.” His point was that it’s the attention to detail that matters.

During the economic expansion of the Song dynasty, which lasted from 960 to 1279, “the world’s first true cuisine” emerged, as Dunlop writes in her cookbook Land of Fish and Rice. New varieties of rice imported from Vietnam revolutionised farming by allowing the planting of two crops a year, and innovations in cultivation increased yields. The Chinese population boomed, and sophisticated commercial networks sprang up to transport rice, sugar, tea, wine, dried hams and condiments around the country. Novelties like oranges and grapes became widely available, and tea was transformed from a luxury into a daily necessity.

The material abundance of this era, Dunlop writes, spawned “a complex gastronomic culture in which food was not only cooked and enjoyed, but also elaborated, discussed and documented”. Records of the Fresh and Strange, written by a 10th-century scholar and poet, celebrated specialities of the lower Yangtze delta such as sweet pears, loquats and a “noodle so pliable that it could be tied in knots”, as Jin Feng writes in Tasting Paradise on Earth, a history of the region’s food. Su Dongpo, an imperial official and one of China’s most revered poets, wrote about humble dishes of pork and cabbage. (His recipe for turnip soup, which was recorded in 1098, survives to this day.) Appreciation of fine food was a mark of culture, like being accomplished in calligraphy, painting and poetry.

In 1127, the Song capital city of Kaifeng fell to invaders from Manchuria, forcing the remnants of the imperial court to flee south. On the shores of West Lake they built a new capital, Hangzhou, which became the largest and richest city in the world at that time. On a visit during the late 13th century, Marco Polo was impressed by the numbers of those “accustomed to dainty living, to the point of eating fish and meat at one meal”. With its mix of natives and refugees from the north, the city was something of a melting pot, which was reflected in its cooking. Northern dishes were remade with southern ingredients: shrimp was substituted for mutton, and pastries became lighter and flakier. The fusion of regional cooking styles – the art of mixture, on a large scale – created a truly national cuisine, although not everyone was pleased. “Food and drink have become all confused, with no longer any distinction between southern and northern,” one scholar complained.

In The Eastern Capital: A Dream of Splendour, the twelfth-century gourmet Meng Yuanlao described, street by street and dish by dish, the culinary delights of Kaifeng around 1120, when he lived there as a young man: “Even if there are only two men sitting across from each other, they must use a set of bowls with fluted handles … Even if one drinks alone, such items as silver bowls are used. The fruits and vegetables are fine and exquisite.” He recalled his favourite dishes: quail eggs, fried loyang snow pears.

By the time Meng wrote this, the city as he had known it no longer existed; it had fallen to invaders two decades before. Food is ephemeral, but so are places: buildings, streets, even a flourishing capital can disappear like a fondly remembered meal. At the root of the Chinese gastronomic tradition is a yearning for a lost age. Through words, we create what no longer exists in the world.

Dunlop has engaged deeply with this tradition. She can pinpoint the earliest appearance in the gastronomical literature of soy sauce, the first use of the word for “stir-fry” and the etymological origins of the term dim sum. Like so many of her Chinese predecessors, she regards food with a moralist’s eye. She would like readers not just to appreciate the wonders of Chinese cooking but also to value the healthy and sustainable approach that lies behind it.

In other ways, she blows up the tradition altogether. Dunlop, as a woman who cooks and writes, breaks with a long line of male intellectuals who tended to discourse about food from a certain remove and didn’t actually cook. (The sage Mencius said: “The gentleman keeps his distance from the kitchen.”) Knowing how to eat well was a sign of refinement, but cooking itself has always been low-status. Dunlop’s classmates in culinary school were almost all young men from working-class or rural families.

“If we were making pork balls, we had to pound the meat to a paste with the backs of our cleavers,” she writes. “If we were using walnuts, we had to crack them open, soak them and then, laboriously, peel off their skins.” Cooking is labour, and Dunlop can convey the painstaking multiday process of preparing a dish like braised pomelo pith with shrimp eggs while also tracing the Chinese predilection for using such unlikely ingredients back to the 16th century BC.

Of course, Dunlop’s foreignness also sets her apart. In the extensive coverage of her work and life in the Chinese media, she is “the Cambridge graduate who came to China to cook”, “the English person with a Chinese stomach”, “the foreigner who understands Chinese food best”. “She lends legitimacy to Chinese culture and Chinese cooking at a time when Chinese people really need that affirmation,” Tzui Chuang, a Taiwanese-American food writer, told me.

One of Dunlop’s goals is to rescue Chinese food from its reputation in the west as “popular, but … cheap, low-status and junky”. As she explains in Invitation to a Banquet, the earliest Chinese restaurateurs abroad – beginning with those who went to California during the Gold Rush in the 1840s – were uneducated labourers with no culinary training. The dishes that they made, like deep-fried wontons and sweet-and-sour everything, were nothing like the sophisticated cuisine back home.

Chinese food in the west remained a “bastardised form of Cantonese cuisine”, and this fed a stereotype of the Chinese as slovenly and undiscriminating eaters. Lord Macartney, the leader of a 1793 British diplomatic mission to China, described the Chinese as “foul feeders and eaters of garlic and strong-scented vegetables”. In 2002, the Daily Mail called Chinese food “the dodgiest in the world, created by a nation that eats bats, snakes, monkeys, bears’ paws, birds’ nests, sharks’ fins, ducks’ tongues and chickens’ feet”. More recently, the possibility that the Covid-19 virus emerged in a Chinese market that sold wild animals revived the old “Chinese will eat anything” tropes, though Dunlop notes that consumption of exotic species is limited to a tiny subset of the population and is controversial in China, too.

She takes pains to point out that the Chinese are discerning about ingredients and have always emphasised the links between food and health. The quest for nutritious produce in China created a far more diverse array of foods than is known in the west. Dunlop devotes five pages to the “vast clan of cabbages” before moving on to “the punchy alliums, the tribe of onions and garlics”, and then to bamboo shoots, roots and tubers, gourds, mushrooms and seaweeds. She explores the unfamiliar world of vegetables that are harvested from the water, such as water chestnuts and lotus plants, a category that doesn’t exist in western cooking. She describes the fantastic range of flavours and textures that the Chinese have wrought from tofu, which can be silken or firm, smoked or spiced, stir-fried, deep-fried, frozen, toasted, pressed into sheets, soaked in brine or moulded and fermented into “a delicious state of dishevelment, as high and wild as stilton on the brink between ripeness and decay” – a reminder of the double standards that have made western gourmets devalue Chinese food in favour of their own.

Dunlop also traces the surprising openness of the Chinese to foreign foods throughout history. (Her scholarship builds on Food in Chinese Culture, a classic 1977 study of Chinese food history edited by the archaeologist KC Chang.) During the Han dynasty, which lasted from 206BC to AD220, exotic foods such as grapes, pomegranates, walnuts, sesame, onions, peas, alfalfa, coriander and cucumbers entered the country from central Asia. In the Ming dynasty, which lasted from the mid-14th to the mid-17th century and was known for its isolationist policies, corn, peanuts, white potatoes and sweet potatoes arrived from the new world. Two other new world transplants, the chilli pepper and the tomato, were adopted more recently and further transformed the cuisine.

For a long time historians assumed that Chinese cooking developed its enormous variety because people had to make the most of scarce resources. More recent scholarship suggests that the centrality of food drove innovation. Dunlop underscores the value that the Chinese have always placed on culinary ingenuity: pragmatism and pleasure, not poverty, were always the impetus. To understand the Chinese through their culinary history is also to see them in their best lights – as inventive, adaptable, egalitarian and open-minded. Maybe only a foreigner can see this and say this.

Dunlop’s initial encounters with China took place in what she calls “this prelapsarian world of cooking”. In the early 1990s, families in Chengdu and around the country still cooked dinner on charcoal braziers, made their own pickled cabbage and smoked sausage, and shopped every day for meat and vegetables in open-air markets. In the lanes and alleys of the old city, Dunlop met knife sharpeners and tofu vendors, ate delicious noodle lunches for pennies, and tasted classic Sichuanese dishes like fish-fragrant aubergine and twice-cooked pork for the first time. “On warm evenings we would drift down to the riverbank outside the university, where a rash of alfresco restaurants had sprung up under the wutong trees,” she writes, evoking a lost Eden that she only gradually realised was disappearing.

As the country’s economic progress picked up speed, Dunlop witnessed the demolition of Chengdu’s old wooden houses, streets and entire neighbourhoods to make way for highways and high-rises. “My culinary researches began as an attempt to document a living city,” she writes in her memoir. “Later, it became clear to me that, in many ways, I was writing an epitaph.”

In the three decades since Dunlop first went to China, the country’s food system has also been transformed. Western fast food restaurants arrived, followed by supermarket chains and megamarkets such as Carrefour and Walmart, all of which led to increased consumption of western-style processed and packaged foods, saturated fats and sugary beverages. “Just like much of the US, it was becoming easier for Chinese urban consumers to buy out-of-season fruit from thousands of miles away than it was to get fresh produce from the farm just outside town,” writes Thomas David DuBois in China in Seven Banquets, a history of Chinese food that gives a good picture of contemporary developments.

A generation ago most Chinese people knew how to cook; in some parts of the country, including Sichuan, it was common for men to be the primary cooks in the family. But rising living standards and a hyper-competitive work culture have changed that. Many Chinese in their 20s and 30s don’t know how to cook or are too busy to do so. According to recent surveys, more than half the population now eats most of its meals outside the home or relies on food delivery services, which have become ubiquitous over the past decade.

Many Chinese are losing touch with the tradition of healthy eating that Dunlop so earnestly celebrates. Consumption of whole grains, legumes and vegetables is in steep decline. According to a 2021 article in the journal Public Health Nutrition, the Chinese now get 30% of their calories from animal products and 29% from industrially processed foods. In 1990, the figures were 9.5% and 1.5%, respectively. Obesity has increased fivefold; the Chinese suffer increasingly from the chronic ailments, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease, that afflict so many millions in the developed world.

The yearning for a simpler and healthier past informs much of recent Chinese gastronomical commentary. Among the most influential is A Bite of China, a hugely popular TV series that explores the country’s culinary heritage, with episodes on rural villagers harvesting lotus root or making glutinous millet buns using traditional methods. One of China’s biggest social media stars is Li Ziqi, a former nightclub DJ who makes mesmerising, near-wordless videos of herself hiking up hillsides in rural Sichuan to chop firewood and pick mushrooms or planting and harvesting cucumbers, peppers and squash in large bamboo baskets. Nearly every video ends with her cooking dishes over a wood fire and sharing a meal with her grandmother in what looks like a cottage without electricity. Li’s videos, which have gained her tens of millions of followers, present cooking as an extravagant rural fantasy and inadvertently convey how exhausting it is to put dinner on the table.

When Dunlop first lived in Chengdu, she and her classmates frequented a noodle shop near the university that was owned by a man called Xie Laoban – “Boss Xie”. He was a type recognised by anybody who has lived in China – the stony-faced, chain-smoking proprietor who never cracks a smile or says a word in greeting. Over the years, Dunlop returned for a nostalgic bite whenever she passed through the city. She somehow convinced this uncommunicative man to share his recipe for dandan mian, a bowl of noodles topped with crispy minced beef and spicy seasonings that is a classic Chengdu street snack. “In all my wanderings,” Dunlop writes, “I have never come across dan dan noodles as delicious.”

The last time she visited the shop, in 2001, the neighbourhood was being torn down for development: “The lanes around Xie Laoban’s noodle shop lay in ruins, bony cadavers of wood and bamboo, and his restaurant clung to one or two other little shops in a precarious island among them …. I sat there and ate my noodles, which were as fabulous as ever, and then it was time to go. I never saw Xie Laoban again. Later that year, I went to look for him. I wanted to tell him that I had described him and his shop in my Sichuanese cookery book, and published his recipe for dan dan noodles, which was now being read and perhaps cooked by a network of Sichuanese food fans all over the world. But the place where his noodle shop had stood was a moonscape of debris, a great plain of rubble, scattered here and there with shattered pickle jars and rice bowls. And none of the passersby knew where I could find him.”

With its amazing beaches, rich history, excellent gastronomy and laid-back lifestyle, Barbados is one of the world’s most desirable holiday destinations. The island’s average daytime temperature is 30C all year round with permanently warm seas and a prevailing north-eastern trade wind rolling in off the Atlantic to prevent it from ever feeling too hot.

Most of Virgin Atlantic Holidays’ (see boxout below) hotels are found on the island’s stunning west coast where the narrow, golden-sand beaches are lined with villas, smart places to stay, and the sea is calm and crystal clear. A sunset cocktail on one of the palm-shaded hotel terraces between Bridgetown and Speightstown is a memorable way to end a day of sunbathing, jetskiing, snorkelling or lazing in a glass-bottomed boat.

Spend the afternoon at the luxurious Sandy Lane hotel. Built on a former sugar plantation, its Bajan Blue restaurant is the place for high tea and perhaps a round of golf at one of the hotel’s three courses. Sugar production was a major part of the Barbadian economy from the 1600s to the 1900s and fancy plantation houses from colonial times are scattered around the island, many of which are open for visits and rum tastings.

The capital, Bridgetown, named after an old Indian bridge which spanned the Constitution River, has the best of the island’s shopping, with fashion boutiques along Broad Street and Swan Street as well as craft centres, spectacular fish markets and the Agapey chocolate factory (not just for kids). Have a wander around the Garrison Historic area, a Unesco world heritage site, dotted with forts and brightly coloured British colonial buildings including the Main Guard, a marvel of military design with clocktower and cannons overlooking the racecourse. Nearby is George Washington house, an elegant plantation residence where the future American president stayed as a teenager in 1751. Other sights near the centre include the Harry Bayley Observatory, the Gun Hill Signal Station and the visitor centre at Mount Gay, the world’s oldest rum producer.

Heading inland, rare orchids, mango trees and huge baobabs can be found in the Flower Forest Botanical Gardens. Even more spectacular is the forested ravine of Welchman Hall Gully, where visitors can view the entire island to the sound of green monkeys chattering in the canopy overhead. Across on the less-developed, rugged east coast is Bathsheba and its huge, globe-shaped rocky outcrops jutting out into the sea from a windswept arc of sand. It’s a surfer’s paradise, while swimmers can enjoy the oversized rockpools beyond the shade of swaying coconut palms.

Besides surfing and swimming, Barbados is a watersports hotspot with excellent sailing facilities, stand-up paddleboard, windsurfing and kitesurfing on Silver Rock and Long beach. Scuba divers can explore the shipwrecks off Carlisle Bay and the Folkestone Marine Park. There are great coastal hikes along the former railway tracks of the eastern flank of the Scotland District from Bathsheba to Bath.

For those who prefer spectating, on their Virgin Atlantic Holidays trip, cricket matches at the Kensington Oval are among the West Indies’ liveliest events, or there’s horse racing at the Barbados Turf Club on Saturday afternoons, polo in St James or a drive-in open-air cinema.

After dark, with cricket bats put away and surfboards safely stored, Bajan culture really comes alive. The Crop Over festival (traditionally the end of the sugar cane harvest) runs for six weeks during the summer which includes plenty of rum punch and live performances of the island’s soca, tuk and calypso music with modern fusions of “chutney soca”, “ragga” and “rapso”.

Bajan gastronomy is a melting pot of influences, though strongly based on fresh fish
Barbados’ culinary heritage is a combination of British and West African flavours with touches of India and a strong emphasis on sugar, pickles and fresh fish. Today, Bajan cuisine is centred around flying fish with cou-cou (okra and cornmeal) and hot pepper sauce, but restaurant menus are full of extravagant-looking lobster, crab and prawn dishes served with tropical fruit and vegetables. Try an octopus salad at The Fish Pot in Fort Rupert or a steak in rum sauce at Cariba in Durants. Cuz’s fish shack on Pebbles beach is a must-try.

Peanut brittle, coconut bread and baked custard are three firm favourites from the dessert trolley, as well as a super-refreshing coconut water inside a football-sized green coconut with a straw, best served at the roadside.

Sign up for a walking Bajan food tour organised by Lickrish and make sure you keep Friday night free for the Oistins fish fry. Held at Bay Gardens beside the fish market, Oistins attracts locals and visitors from all over the island for a night of barbecued barracuda, marlin, kingfish and lobster as well as chicken, ribs and buckets of coleslaw. This is all served at communal tables in a street party atmosphere with a soundtrack of reggae and calypso with steel bands. There’ll be lots of dancing and noisy games of dominoes late into the night.

The world’s newest republic, this pear-shaped island in the south-eastern Caribbean is a dream location for holidaymakers who want to combine beachlife and watersports with gastronomy and culture. Barbados’ botanical gardens, forests, caves and some stunning colonial architecture, including the island’s unique, pastel-coloured chattel houses on its west coast, mean there is so much to see and enjoy. And don’t forget to visit a traditional rum house on your Virgin Atlantic Holidays trip.

As GenAI becomes the primary way to find information, local and traditional wisdom is being lost. And we are only beginning to realise what we’re missing

Afew years back, my dad was diagnosed with a tumour on his tongue – which meant we had some choices to weigh up. My family has an interesting dynamic when it comes to medical decisions. While my older sister is a trained doctor in western allopathic medicine, my parents are big believers in traditional remedies. Having grown up in a small town in India, I am accustomed to rituals. My dad had a ritual, too. Every time we visited his home village in southern Tamil Nadu, he’d get a bottle of thick, pungent, herb-infused oil from a vaithiyar, a traditional doctor practising Siddha medicine. It was his way of maintaining his connection with the kind of medicine he had always known and trusted.

Dad’s tumour showed signs of being malignant, so the hospital doctors and my sister strongly recommended surgery. My parents were against the idea, worried it could affect my dad’s speech. This is usually where I come in, as the expert mediator in the family. Like any good millennial, I turned to the internet for help in guiding the decision. After days of thorough research, I (as usual) sided with my sister and pushed for surgery. The internet backed us up.

We eventually got my dad to agree and even set a date. But then, he slyly used my sister’s pregnancy as a distraction to skip the surgery altogether. While we pestered him every day to get it done, he was secretly taking his herbal concoction. And, lo and behold, after several months the tumour actually shrank and eventually disappeared. The whole episode earned my dad some bragging rights.

At the time, I dismissed it as a lucky exception. But recently I’ve been wondering if I was too quick to dismiss my parents’ trust in traditional knowledge, while accepting the authority of digitally dominant sources. I find it hard to believe that my dad’s herbal concoctions worked, but I have also come to realise that the seemingly all-knowing internet I so readily trusted contains huge gaps – and that, in a world of AI, it’s about to get worse.

The irony isn’t lost on me that this dilemma has emerged through my research at a university in the United States, in a setting removed from my childhood and the very context where traditional practices were part of daily life. At Cornell University, New York, I study what it takes to design responsible AI systems. My work has been revealing, showing me how the digital world reflects profound power imbalances in knowledge, and how this is amplified by generative AI (GenAI). The early internet was dominated by the English language and western institutions, and this imbalance has hardened over time, leaving whole worlds of human knowledge and experience undigitised. Now, with the rise of GenAI – which is trained on this available digital corpus – that asymmetry threatens to become entrenched.

For many people, GenAI is emerging as the primary way to learn about the world. A large-scale study published in September 2025, analysing how people have been using ChatGPT since its launch in November 2022, revealed that around half the queries were for practical guidance, or to seek information. These systems may appear neutral, but they are far from it. The most popular models privilege dominant ways of knowing (typically western and institutional) while marginalising alternatives, especially those encoded in oral traditions, embodied practice and languages considered “low-resource” in the computing world, such as Hindi or Swahili.

By amplifying these hierarchies, GenAI risks contributing to the erasure of systems of understanding that have evolved over centuries, disconnecting future generations from vast bodies of insight and wisdom that were never encoded yet remain essential, human ways of knowing. What’s at stake, then, isn’t just representation: it’s the resilience and diversity of knowledge itself.

GenAI is trained on massive datasets of text from sources such as books, articles, websites and transcripts – hence the name “large language model” (LLM). But this “training data” is far from the sum total of human knowledge, with oral cultures and even languages underrepresented or absent.

To understand why this matters, we must first recognise that languages serve as vessels for knowledge. Each language carries entire worlds of human experience and insight developed over centuries: the rituals and customs that shape communities, distinctive ways of seeing beauty and creating art, deep familiarity with specific landscapes and natural systems, spiritual and philosophical worldviews, subtle vocabularies for inner experiences, specialised expertise in various fields, frameworks for organising society and justice, collective memories and historical narratives, healing traditions and intricate social bonds.

When AI systems lack adequate exposure to a language, they have blind spots in their comprehension of human experience. Data from Common Crawl, one of the largest public sources of training data, reveals stark inequalities. It contains more than 300 billion webpages spanning 18 years, but English, which is spoken by approximately 19% of the global population, dominates, with 45% of the content. However, there can be an alarming imbalance between a language’s demographic size and how well that language is represented in online data. Take Hindi, the third most popular language globally, spoken by about 7.5% of the world’s population. It accounts for only 0.2% of Common Crawl’s data. The situation is even more dire for Tamil, my own mother tongue. Despite being spoken by more than 86 million people worldwide, it represents just 0.04% of the data.

In the computing world, approximately 97% of the world’s languages are classified as “low-resource”. This designation is misleading when applied beyond computing contexts: many of these languages boast millions of speakers and carry centuries-old traditions of rich linguistic heritage. They are simply underrepresented online or in accessible datasets. A study from 2020 showed that 88% of the world’s languages face such severe neglect in AI technologies that bringing them up to speed would be a herculean – perhaps impossible – effort.

To illustrate the kinds of knowledge missing, let’s consider one example: our understanding of local ecologies. An environmentalist friend once told me something that has stayed with me – a community’s connection with its ecology can be seen through the detailed and specific names it has for local plants. Because plant species are often regionally specific or ecologically unique, knowledge of these plants becomes equally localised. When a language becomes marginalised, the plant knowledge embedded within it often disappears as well.

While writing this essay, I spoke to various people about the language gaps in GenAI – among them Dharan Ashok, chief architect at Thannal, an organisation dedicated to reviving natural building techniques in India. He agreed that there is a strong connection between language and local ecological knowledge, and that this in turn underpins Indigenous architectural knowledge. While modern construction is largely synonymous with concrete and steel, Indigenous building methods relied on materials available in the surrounding environment.

Amid concerns over unsustainable and carbon-intensive construction, Dharan is actively working to recover the lost art of producing biopolymers from local plants. He noted that the greatest challenge lies in the fact that this knowledge is largely undocumented and has been passed down orally through native languages. It is often held by just a few elders, and when they pass away, it is lost. Dharan recounted an experience of missing the chance to learn how to make a specific type of limestone-based brick when the last artisan with that knowledge died.

To understand how certain ways of knowing rise to global dominance, often at the expense of Indigenous knowledge, it helps to consider the idea of cultural hegemony developed by the Italian philosopher Antonio Gramsci.

Gramsci argued that power is maintained not solely through force or economic control, but also through the shaping of cultural norms and everyday beliefs. Over time, epistemological approaches rooted in western traditions have come to be seen as objective and universal. This has normalised western knowledge as the standard, obscuring the historical and political forces that enabled its rise. Institutions such as schools, scientific bodies and international development organisations have helped entrench this dominance.

Epistemologies are not just abstract and cognitive. They are all around us, with a direct impact on our bodies and lived experiences. To understand how, let’s consider an example that contrasts sharply with the kind of Indigenous construction practices that Dharan seeks to revive: high-rise buildings with glass facades in the tropics.

Far from being neutral or purely aesthetic choices, glass buildings reflect a tradition rooted in western architectural modernism. Originally designed for colder, low-light climates, these buildings were praised for their perceived energy efficiency, allowing ample daylight into interiors and reducing reliance on artificial lighting.

However, when this design is applied in tropical regions, it turns into an environmental contradiction. In places with intense sunlight, studies have shown that glass facades lead to significant indoor overheating and thermal discomfort, even with modern glazing. Rather than conserving energy, these buildings demand more energy use to remain cool.

Yet glass facades have become the face of urban modernity, whether in San Francisco, Jakarta or Lagos – regardless of climate or cultural context. As climate breakdown accelerates, these glass buildings are gleaming reminders of the dangers of knowledge homogenisation. Ironically, I’m writing this from inside one of those very buildings in Bengaluru in southern India. I sit in cooled air with the soft hum of the air conditioner in my ears. Outside in the drizzle, it seems to be a normal monsoon afternoon, except the rains arrived weeks early this year – another sign of growing climate unpredictability.

In Bengaluru, I see yet another example of the impacts of lost knowledge: water management. How can a city flood severely in May, submerging cars, yet scramble for water even for domestic use in March? While poor planning and unchecked urbanisation play their part, the issue also has epistemological roots.

Bengaluru was once celebrated for its smart water-management system, fed by a series of interconnected cascading lakes. For centuries, these lakes were managed by dedicated groups, such as the Neeruganti community (neeru means “water” in the Kannada language), who controlled water flow and ensured fair distribution. Depending on the rains, they guided farmers on which crops to grow, often suggesting water-efficient varieties. They also handled upkeep: desilting tanks, planting vegetation to prevent erosion and clearing feeder channels.

But with modernisation, community-led water management gave way to centralised systems and individual solutions such as irrigation from far-off dams and bore wells. The “Green Revolution” of the late 1960s – when India embraced modern industrial agriculture – added to this shift, pushing water- and fertiliser-heavy crops developed in western labs. The Neerugantis were sidelined, and many moved on in search of other work. Local lakes and canals declined, and some were even built over, replaced with roads, buildings or bus stops.

Experts have realised that the key to saving Bengaluru from its water crisis lies in bringing these lake systems back to life. A social worker I spoke with, who’s been involved in several of these projects, said they often turn to elders from the Neeruganti community for advice. Their insights are valuable, but their local knowledge is not written down, and their role as community water managers has long been delegitimised. Knowledge exists only in their native language, passed on orally, and is mostly absent from digital spaces – let alone AI systems.

While all my examples so far are drawn from India due to personal familiarity, such hierarchies are widespread, rooted in the global history of imperialism and colonialism. In her book Decolonizing Methodologies (1999), the Māori scholar Linda Tuhiwai Smith emphasises that colonialism profoundly disrupted local knowledge systems – and the cultural and intellectual foundations on which they were built – by severing ties to land, language, history and social structures. Smith’s insights reveal how these processes are not confined to a single region but form part of a broader legacy that continues to shape how knowledge is produced and valued. It is on this distorted foundation that today’s digital and GenAI systems are built.

Irecently worked with Microsoft Research, examining several GenAI deployments built for non-western populations. Observing how these AI models often miss cultural contexts, overlook local knowledge and frequently misalign with their target community has brought home to me just how much they encode existing biases and exclude marginalised knowledge.

The work has also brought me closer to understanding the technical reasons why such inequalities develop inside the models. The problem is far deeper than gaps in training data. By design, LLMs also tend to reproduce and reinforce the most statistically prevalent ideas, creating a feedback loop that narrows the scope of accessible human knowledge.

Why so? The internal representation of knowledge in an LLM is not uniform. Concepts that appear more frequently, more prominently or across a wider range of contexts in the training data tend to be more strongly encoded. For example, if pizza is commonly mentioned as a favourite food across a broad set of training texts, when asked “what’s your favourite food?”, the model is more likely to respond with “pizza” because that association is more statistically prominent.

More subtly, the model’s output distribution does not directly reflect the frequency of ideas in the training data. Instead, LLMs often amplify dominant patterns or ideas in a way that distorts their original proportions. This phenomenon can be referred to as “mode amplification”.

Suppose the training data includes 60% references to pizza, 30% to pasta and 10% to biryani as favourite foods. One might expect the model to reproduce this distribution if asked the same question 100 times. However, in practice, LLMs tend to overproduce the most frequent answer. Pizza may appear more than 60 times, while less frequent items such as biryani may be underrepresented or omitted altogether. This occurs because LLMs are optimised to predict the most probable next “token” (the next word or word fragment in a sequence), which leads to a disproportionate emphasis on high-likelihood responses.

This uneven encoding gets further skewed through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), where GenAI models are fine-tuned based on human preferences. This inevitably embeds the values and worldviews of their creators into the models themselves. Ask ChatGPT about a controversial topic and you’ll get a diplomatic response that sounds like it was crafted by a panel of lawyers and HR professionals who are overly eager to please you. Ask Grok, X’s AI chatbot, the same question and you might get a sarcastic quip followed by a politically charged take that would fit right in at a certain tech billionaire’s dinner party.

Commercial pressures add another layer entirely. The most lucrative users – English-speaking professionals willing to pay $20-200 monthly for premium AI subscriptions – become the implicit template for “superintelligence”. These models excel at generating quarterly reports, coding in Silicon Valley’s preferred languages and crafting emails that sound appropriately deferential to western corporate hierarchies. Meanwhile, they stumble over cultural contexts that don’t translate to quarterly earnings.

It should not come as a surprise that a growing body of studies shows how LLMs predominantly reflect western cultural values and epistemologies. They overrepresent certain dominant groups in their outputs, reinforce and amplify the biases held by these groups, and are more factually accurate on topics associated with North America and Europe. Even in domains such as travel recommendations or storytelling, LLMs tend to generate richer and more detailed content for wealthier countries compared with poorer ones.

And beyond merely reflecting existing knowledge hierarchies, GenAI has the capacity to amplify them, as human behaviour changes alongside it. The integration of AI overviews in search engines, along with the growing popularity of AI-powered search engines such as Perplexity, underscores this shift.

As AI-generated content has started to fill the internet, it adds another layer of amplification to ideas that are already popular online. The internet, as the primary source of knowledge for AI models, becomes recursively influenced by the very outputs those models generate. With each training cycle, new models increasingly rely on AI-generated content. This risks creating a feedback loop where dominant ideas are continuously amplified while long-tail or niche knowledge fades from view.

The AI researcher Andrew Peterson describes this phenomenon as “knowledge collapse”: a gradual narrowing of the information humans can access, along with a declining awareness of alternative or obscure viewpoints. As LLMs are trained on data shaped by previous AI outputs, underrepresented knowledge can become less visible – not because it lacks merit, but because it is less frequently retrieved or cited. Peterson also warns of the “streetlight effect”, named after the joke where a person searches for lost keys under a streetlight at night because that’s where the light is brightest. In the context of AI, this would be people searching where it’s easiest rather than where it’s most meaningful. Over time, this would result in a degenerative narrowing of the public knowledge base.

Across the globe, GenAI is also becoming part of formal education, used to generate learning content and support self-paced education through AI tutors. For example, the state government of Karnataka, home to the city of Bengaluru, has partnered with the US-based nonprofit Khan Academy to deploy Khanmigo, an AI-powered learning assistant, in schools and colleges. I would be surprised if Khanmigo holds the insights of elder Neerugantis – grounded in local knowledge and practices – needed to teach school students in Karnataka how to care for their water ecologies.

All this means that, in a world where AI increasingly mediates access to knowledge, future generations may lose connection with vast bodies of experience, insight and wisdom. AI developers could argue that this is simply a data problem, solvable by incorporating more diverse sources into training datasets. While that might be technically possible, the challenges of data sourcing, prioritisation and representation are far more complex than such a solution implies.

This was brought into focus by a conversation I had with a senior leader involved in the development of an AI chatbot which serves more than 8 million farmers across Asia and Africa. The system provides agricultural advice based mostly on databases from government advisories and international development organisations, which tend to rely on research literature. The leader acknowledged how many local practices that could be effective are still excluded from the chat responses, because they are not documented in the research literature.

The rationale isn’t that research-backed advice is always right or risk-free. It’s that it offers a defensible position if something goes wrong. In a system this large, leaning on recognised sources is seen as the safer bet, protecting an organisation from liability while sidelining knowledge that hasn’t been vetted through institutional channels. So the decision is more than just technical. It’s a compromise shaped by the structural context, not based on what is most useful or true.

This structural context doesn’t just shape institutional choices. It also shapes the kinds of challenges I heard about in my conversation with Perumal Vivekanandan, founder of the nonprofit organisation Sustainable-agriculture and Environmental Voluntary Action (Seva). His experiences highlight the uphill battle faced by those working to legitimise Indigenous knowledge.

Formed in 1992, Seva focuses on preserving and disseminating Indigenous knowledge in agriculture, animal husbandry and the conservation of agricultural biodiversity in India. Over the years, Vivekanandan has documented more than 8,600 local practices and adaptations, travelling village to village.

Still, the work constantly runs into systemic roadblocks. Potential funders often withhold support, questioning the scientific legitimacy of the knowledge Seva seeks to promote. When Seva turns to universities and research institutions to help validate this knowledge, they often signal a lack of incentives to engage. Some even suggest that Seva should fund the validation studies itself. This creates a catch-22: without validation, Seva struggles to gain support; but without support, it can’t afford validation. The process reveals a deeper challenge: finding ways to validate Indigenous knowledge within systems that have historically undervalued it.

Seva’s story shows that while GenAI may be accelerating the erasure of local knowledge, it is not the root cause. The marginalisation of local and Indigenous knowledge has long been driven by entrenched power structures. GenAI simply puts this process on steroids.

We often frame the loss of Indigenous knowledge as a tragedy only for the local communities who hold it. But ultimately, the loss is not just theirs to bear, but belongs to the world at large.

The disappearance of local knowledge is not a trivial loss. It is a disruption to the larger web of understanding that sustains both human and ecological wellbeing. Just as biological species have evolved to thrive in specific local environments, human knowledge systems are adapted to the particularities of place. When these systems are disrupted, the consequences can ripple far beyond their point of origin.

Wildfire smoke doesn’t care about transgressing postcodes. Polluted water doesn’t pause at state lines. Rising temperatures ignore national borders. Infectious germs don’t have visa waiting periods. Whether we acknowledge it or not, we are enmeshed in shared ecological systems where local wounds inevitably become global aches.

The biggest contradiction for me in writing this essay is that I’m trying to convince readers of the legitimacy and importance of local knowledge systems while I myself remain unconvinced about my dad’s herbal concoctions. This uncertainty feels like a betrayal of everything I’ve argued for here. Yet maybe it’s exactly the kind of honest complexity we need to navigate.

I have my doubts about whether Indigenous knowledge truly works as claimed in every case. Especially when influencers and politicians invoke it superficially for likes or to exploit identity politics, generating misinformation without sincere inquiry. However, I’m equally wary of letting it disappear. We may lose something valuable, only to recognise its worth much later. And what’s the collateral damage of that process? An ecological collapse we could have prevented?

The climate crisis is revealing cracks in our dominant knowledge paradigms. Yet at the same time, AI developers are convinced that their technology will accelerate scientific progress and solve our greatest challenges. I really want to believe they’re right. But several questions remain: are we capable of moving towards this technological future while authentically engaging with the knowledge systems we’ve dismissed, with genuine curiosity beyond tokenism? Or will we keep erasing forms of understanding through the hierarchies we’ve built, and find ourselves scrambling to colonise Mars because we never learned to listen to those who knew how to live sustainably on Earth?

Maybe the intelligence we most need is the capacity to see beyond the hierarchies that determine which knowledge counts. Without that foundation, regardless of the hundreds of billions we pour into developing superintelligence, we’ll keep erasing knowledge systems that took generations to develop.

I don’t know if my dad’s herbal concoctions worked. But I’m learning that acknowledging I don’t know might be the most honest place to start.
